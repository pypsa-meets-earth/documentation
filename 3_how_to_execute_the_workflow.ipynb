    "[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is our workflow management tool which allows you to define and excute workflow in a flexible manner. It safes you plenty of time! As a first inspiration:\n",

    "5. Type the following in the terminal: \n",

Just image you would need to execute script by script by hand. Not impossible for the workflow below, but just imagine you have 100 or 1000 optimisation. Snakemake saves your valuable time in such situations.",

    "Sometimes visualization with the directive above may result in an error like 'Error: <stdin>: syntax error in line 1 near 'Restricted''. (Big thanks to Yiliao Zhou for reporting this issue!) This error appears if the Snakemake output contains some text (like solver info messages) which is not supposed to be there by the graphiz visualizer. The solution is to get rid of this additional text. For example, we may cut a part of the output which is meaningful for building a workflow graph with `snakemake --dag solve_all_networks | sed -n \"/digraph/,/}/p\" | dot -Tpng -o workflow.png`.",
