## Getting ready to change the world

This repository contains the documentation of PyPSA-Earth including:

- hackathon material in folder `hackathon`  (mandatory for beginners): it contains a 6-step introduction starting from the basics to learn PyPSA-Earth
- sample notebooks to investigate the PyPSA-Earth repository in the folder `notebooks`
- storage of documentation images in the folder `doc`

## Installation

1. Make sure to have installed the PyPSA-Earth package and environment available at [this link](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth.git)

2. Open your terminal at the parent location where PyPSA-Earth has been installed. Type the following in your terminal to download the package from GitHub:

   ```bash
      .../pypsa/earth/parent/folder % git clone https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/documentation.git
   ```

## 1. Hackathon material

Expected experience level: Beginner  
Duration hackathon: 3 hours  
Duration extra DIY exercises: 5 hours

### Content

Slides and jupyter notebook examples are provided in the folder `hackathon`. While there is a lot of theory and text, we always recommend to code & check out stuff where possible. Small examples also help you to "do rather than only observe".

- Full GitHub workflow exercise for a PyPSA-Earth contribution
- The architecture of PyPSA-Earth on GitHub
- Development tools, requirements and installation of PyPSA-Earth
- 3 ways of Snakemake executions and introduction to debugging
- Code-Dev story on efficient vs. poor code and the role of discord
- Guideline on "How to add to need regions to PyPSA-Earth"
- Wrap-up - Hackathon-slides.pdf

### List of selected self-learning material

Aim: We provide a couple of links to efficient self-learning material

- [Fundamentals of energy economics and energy systems](https://nworbmot.org/teaching.html), great open lecture materials from Tom Brown
- [Unix-Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), the Unix shell is fundamental to a wide range of advanced computing tasks, including high-performance computing
- [Python Dojo](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBZBJbE_rGRWeh5mIBhD-hhDwSEDxogDg), a series of Python videos for absolute beginners

## 2. Notebooks for data exploration

The folder `notebooks` contains useful notebooks to explore the data of PyPSA-Earth.
The notebooks are self-explanatory and the `pypsa-earth` environment is needed to successfully run the examples.
