    "\n",
    "The PyPSA Africa model aims to be the first open-source digital twin energy model of the African energy system, built with africa.\n",
    "The main objective of the package is to answer socio-economic and technical challenges to support policy decision making and technical experts in developing electrification masterplans, planning renewable sources projects and developing policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The above is remarkably important in developing countries and PyPSA Africa aims at providing tools to support a fast transition of any economy to a modern green strong industrial and commercial powerhouse, based on the will of their policy makers and population.\n",

    "### 1.2. Special features\n",
    "\n",
    "In this subsection, we recall the special features that PyPSA Africa provides to better explain why specific architecture approaches have been selected\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.1. Application-oriented features\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, PyPSA Africa has been and is being developed to address the following technical-oriented requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Investment and dispatch optimization**: investment planning and dispatch analyses are a must-have for energy models to support policy makers and utilities to properly address the technical, social and economic implications of the future needs of the system, while coping with security and adequacy requirements.\n",
    "  PyPSA Africa shall provide a unique co-planning and dispatch tool for supporting investment decisions in a robust and verifiable manner to facilitate the energy analysis also for entities with limited resources.\n",
    "  In particular, the tool will enable a co-planning and co-dispatch of multi-regional areas, thus supporting cooperation among different countries, which is a remarkable novelty.\n",
    "  By using accurate dispatch analyses, utilities can also understand the bottlenecks of the current system and plan ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *To cope with this requirement, specific scripts and 'rules' shall be developed to perform such analyses*\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario analysis**: scenarios play a significant role in addressing the future needs and keep the system reliable, adequate and resilient.\n",
    "  Demand growth scenarios as well as the production of renewable sources, accounting for climate-change effects, shall be easy to address.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  *To cope with this requirement, configuration parameters shall be available to users to perform the desired analyses*\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjustable resolution and grid modelling**: the tool shall be easy to perform detailed analysis focused on specific small regions (e.g. space resolution of provinces for country-specific analyses), as well as being able to analyze the entire African country using a larger space resolution (e.g. space resolution of regions for continent-wise analyses).\n",
    "  Such adjustable parameters shall focus on both spacial resolution, such as what countries the analysis shall focus on, as well as time resolution, which means the specific time horizon for the current optimization.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  *To cope with this requirement, configuration parameters shall be available to calibrate the spatial and temporal resolution, as well the region under interest*\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-horizon optimization** (see [PyPSA-EUR-SEC](https://pypsa-eur-sec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)): building on previous experience, the model shall be able to perform multi-year and multi-horizon analyses to successfully support policy-oriented measures and cope with the socio-economic dynamics of the system.\n",
    "  The above is remarkably important in developing countries where the population growth is significant as well the socio-economic transitions can have fast dynamics.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  *To cope with this requirement, configuration parameters and scripts shall be available to users to perform multi-horizon analyses*\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sector-coupled optimization** (see [PyPSA-EUR-SEC](https://pypsa-eur-sec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)): energy is the main backbone of any modern economy, as such PyPSA Africa shall provide energy-wise analysis and not focusing on electricity only\n",
    "  However, electricity is and will be a major energy vector and as such the first development of PyPSA Africa will focus on electricity, to be then extented to multiple energy vectors.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  *To cope with this requirement, scripts shall be available to users to perform sector-coupled analyses*.\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.2. User-oriented features\n",
    "\n",
    "  PyPSA Africa, however, is not only a technical-oriented tool but it's development has been driven to support good user experience\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy to learn and use**: barriers in understanding the code and use shall be minimized\n",
    "  \n",
    "  *To cope with this requirement, PyPSA Africa shall be developed in python*. <img src=\"./images/Python_logo.png\" alt=\"Python\" height=\"40\"/>\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessible, transparent, flexible for incorporating new features and data**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  *To cope with this requirement, PyPSA Africa shall be open-source with a modular structure based on several files each one with a clear scope*.\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "- **Customizability**: the code shall be easy to customize: add new features, new methodologies, new data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *To cope with this requirement, each file of PyPSA Africa shall have an internal modular structure composed by simple functions per each feature*.\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support parallel co-editing**: since the PyPSA Africa community aims to grow large, parallel co-editing shall be supported since the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *To cope with this requirement, PyPSA Africa is available on Github and has a file-wise and architecture-wise modular structure to avoid conflicts*.  <img src=\"./images/Github_logo.png\" alt=\"Github\" height=\"80\"/>\n",
    "  <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automated reproducible workflow**: developing and solving the entire software involves many different steps and methodologies.\n",
    "  To simplify the user experience and enable replicability, the entire workflow shall be automated.\n",
    "\n",
    "  *To cope with this requirement, PyPSA Africa exploits snakemake that is a workflow tool that simplify the development and use of workflow procedures composed by multiple steps*.  <img src=\"./images/snakemake_logo.png\" alt=\"Github\" height=\"25\"/>\n",

    "### 1.3. The Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow is structured in 6 main parts as summarized below.\n",
    "In particular, the entire workflow is automated and executed using `snakemake`.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Workflow overview](./images/workflow_overview.png \"Workflow overview\")\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download data**: the first phase aims at preparing the main raw data needed to execute the code.\n",
    "   In this preliminary phase, PyPSA Africa automatically downloads open source datasets and pre-compiled data bundle needed to perform the execution.\n",
    "   In particular, some input data apply for multiple countries, whereas some are country specific.\n",
    "   Depending on the source, some data can be automatically downloaded from the original source, when that is not possible, a processed data bundle is downloaded from google drive to fill the gap.\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filter data**: most raw data contain NaN values and the structure of the dataset does not comply with the PyPSA requirements.\n",
    "   Data are properly cleaned so that the rest of the workflow can successfully process them in a clean and repeatable way.\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Populate data**: the cleaned data are then processed to generate time series and inputs for building the specific PyPSA model that is used for the simulations.\n",
    "   In this phase, multiple methodologies will be executed depending on the configuration file\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create network model**: once all inputs are generated, then the network model is created successfully.\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Solve model**: the model is solved and results are retrieved\n",
    "   <br><br>\n",
